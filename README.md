# Lychee

A **rust**-based documentation desktop application that allows the user to create **notes** and group them using **tags** rather than a filestructure-based system. Export user-defined **reports** for quick access of notes.

This application was inspired by my messy notes. I have a scratch notebook where I write anything on my mind, and having to search through this book full of commands leads to a nightmare. Thus, Lychee was born. A system in which the user can just write notes called **Nodes**, and the Lychee system sorts out where this note needs to go based on the **Tag** system. No more thinking about which file *X* information belongs in, and no more searching for a niche python script you stached *somewhere* in that /python folder. If the user wants a cheat sheet of all their notes on *X* language, they can create a **Report**, a view of all items categorized by a **Tag**. The possibilities are endless!
